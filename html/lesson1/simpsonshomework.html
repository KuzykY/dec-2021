<h1>The Simpson</h1>
<p>American satirical animated series created by Matt Graining for Fox. The animated series is a satirical parody of the
    US middle class lifestyle, embodied in the Simpsons family of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie. Most of the
    events take place in the fictional town of Springfield. The show ridicules many aspects of people's lives, American
    culture, society, and even American television.</p>
