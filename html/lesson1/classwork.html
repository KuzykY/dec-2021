<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>At SNL, the actor was invited to become the author of several stories. Sandler appeared many times as an opera singer
    and a boy from the dining room. And he began to look at not only as a showman, but also as an actor. Adam worked on
    SNL, starred in "Shakes the Clown", "Eggheads" and signed to Warner Brothers, for which Sandler was later nominated
    for a Grammy. After the release of the album, he felt independent of SNL. Soon the actor was lucky enough to star in
    two very popular films - "Billy Madison" and "Lucky Gilmore". In 1998, Sandler starred in the comedy "Mother's Son"
    by a stupid 31-year-old aquarius boy who lives with his mother. In "Singer at a Wedding", the actor was able to
    express himself to a greater extent.In addition to his work as an actor, Sandler has launched a website where you
    can find many videos and chat directly with the star. He now has a dozen successful comedies, and is one of
    America's most popular comedians.
    He received a Jewish upbringing. His family moved to Manchester, New Hampshire when he was five years old. As a
    child, Sandler was a school clown, often "staging performances" for classmates and teachers. He never thought of
    using his talent as a joker in his career, but his brother nominated Adam for a comedy competition. It immediately
    became apparent that Sandler naturally caused laughter in the audience. He often used his talent in productions.
    After school, Adam taught at New York University, studied art. After several appearances on television in The Cosby
    Show and on MTV in the game show Remote Control, Sandler began to appear fans. In 1989, the actor starred in "Being
    Overboard". Unfortunately, in this film, Sandler could not really demonstrate his comic talents. He graduated with a
    bachelor's degree in 1991. Later in his films, Adam repeatedly referred to memories of his past. Lorem ipsum dolor
